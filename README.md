# Project Title: Salaries of Different Data Science Fields in the Data Science Domain

# OBJECTIVE:

The objective of this project is likely to analyze data science salaries and identify the factors that have the greatest impact on salary. By analyzing this data, the project aims to provide insights into the salaries of data science professionals, which can be used to inform compensation decisions and hiring practices.

* Analyzing maximum, minimum and average salary based on various job role in data science domain.
* Finding insight how experience level imapact on salary.
* Is there a difference in data science salaries based on company location ?
* How does company size make relation with salary on different job role?
* What is the remote job ration as per location?

The overall objective of this project is to provide valuable insights into data science salaries and help inform compensation decisions in the industry.

# NEED OF THIS PROJECT:

The need for this project is to provide insights into data science salaries, which can help inform compensation decisions and practices in the industry. As the demand for data science professionals continues to grow, it's important for companies to offer competitive salaries to attract and retain top talent. At the same time, individuals who are pursuing a career in data science need to have an understanding of what salaries they can expect based on their experience, skills, and other factors.

By analyzing data on data science salaries, this project can help address these needs by providing insights into:

* How much data science professionals are paid on average, and what factors impact their salaries ?
* What skills and experience levels are associated with higher salaries in data science ?
* How different factors such as company location, company size, and remote work impact data science salaries ?
* What trends and patterns can be observed in data science salaries over time ?

The insights generated by this project can be used by individuals to negotiate salaries and by companies to develop competitive compensation packages that attract and retain top talent. Additionally, the project can help promote greater transparency and understanding of compensation practices in the data science industry.

# ABOUT DATASET:
Data Science Job Salaries Dataset contains 11 columns, each are:

* work_year: The year the salary was paid.
* experience_level: The experience level in the job during the year.
* employment_type: The type of employment for the role.
* job_title: The role worked in during the year.
* salary: The total gross salary amount paid.
* salary_currency: The currency of the salary paid.
* salaryinusd: The salary in USD.
* employee_residence: Employee's primary country of residence in during the work year.
* remote_ratio: The overall amount of work done remotely.
* company_location: The country of the employer's main office or contracting branch.
* company_size: The median number of people that worked for the company during the year.

# APPROACH:

The step of the approach:

* Data collection: Collected data from kaggle and convert it into excel format.
* Data cleaning and preparation: Removed duplicates and transformed data into a format that can be analyzed.
* Exploratory data analysis: Through Excel's charts and pivot tables to explored the data and identify patterns and trends. created bar chart, line and area chart.
* Feature selection and engineering: Based on the insights gained from EDA, selected the most important features that have the greatest impact on data science salaries.
* Interpretation and reporting: Finally, interpret the results of the analysis and created reports that summarize the findings and recommendations. Use Excel's charts and graphs to   visualize the results and created professional-looking reports.

Overall, the approach in Excel for this project is involve a combination of data cleaning and preparation, exploratory data analysis using charts and pivot tables, feature selection, interpretation and reporting using charts and graphs.
