# Project Title: Salaries of Different Data Science Fields in the Data Science Domain

# OBJECTIVE:

The objective of this project is likely to analyze data science salaries and identify the factors that have the greatest impact on salary. By analyzing this data, the project aims to provide insights into the salaries of data science professionals, which can be used to inform compensation decisions and hiring practices.

* Analyzing maximum, minimum and average salary based on various job role in data science domain.
* Finding insight how experience level imapact on salary.
* Is there a difference in data science salaries based on company location ?
* How does company size make relation with salary on different job role?
* What is the remote job ration as per location?

The overall objective of this project is to provide valuable insights into data science salaries and help inform compensation decisions in the industry.

# NEED OF THIS PROJECT:

The need for this project is to provide insights into data science salaries, which can help inform compensation decisions and practices in the industry. As the demand for data science professionals continues to grow, it's important for companies to offer competitive salaries to attract and retain top talent. At the same time, individuals who are pursuing a career in data science need to have an understanding of what salaries they can expect based on their experience, skills, and other factors.

By analyzing data on data science salaries, this project can help address these needs by providing insights into:

* How much data science professionals are paid on average, and what factors impact their salaries ?
* What skills and experience levels are associated with higher salaries in data science ?
* How different factors such as company location, company size, and remote work impact data science salaries ?
* What trends and patterns can be observed in data science salaries over time ?

The insights generated by this project can be used by individuals to negotiate salaries and by companies to develop competitive compensation packages that attract and retain top talent. Additionally, the project can help promote greater transparency and understanding of compensation practices in the data science industry.
